# Overview and initial assessment of the dataset (narrative and supplemental information). You should
# describe the structure and content of the dataset and quality issues that are apparent from an initial
# inspection. You should also describe a (hypothetical or real) use case of the dataset and derive from 
# it some data cleaning goals that can achieve the desired fitness for use. In addition: Are their use 
# cases for which the dataset is already clean enough? Others for which it well never be good enough? You# can speculate a bit here – but the rest of the project should focus on a “middle of the road” use case
# that requires a practically feasible amount of data cleaning.
